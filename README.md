# Eleventy Walkthrough

I wanted to learn how to implement Eleventy into a project, but wasn't finding what I needed tutorial-wise. I decided to gather what I already knew, and whatever I learned going forward, into something more linear that I could then refer to in the future.

This started as a one-pager, but I decided to break it out into sections. As of this commit, it still needs a lot more polish, and it will probably see some re-org as we go.

It's in HTML because I'll probably want to put it online at some point, and I don't know what limitations I might run into using other formats.

## Sections added so far:

- Intros to Eleventy and the Guide
- Start (installation and running)
- Basic Data and Templating using Liquid or Nunjucks (EJS will be later)
- Templates and External Markdown Files
- Partials and Include (header and footer)
- Global Data Fies (JSON)
- Pagination
- Server
- Template Languages
- Custom Configuration
- Filters
- Shortcodes
- Using Gulp
- Adding Collections
