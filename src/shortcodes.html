			<p>
				Shortcodes have some similarities to filters, but can provide some extra flexibility. FiltersAllow piping a variable into a function, which then returns a modified form of that variable. <e>Shortcodes</e> are called with mutliple parameters in a very function-like manner. The idea then being that the variables are used to assemble content to be returned. A type of automated layout. There are also <em>Paired Shortcodes</em> with include and end tag. Between the beginning and end tags there can be content which the shortcode can also process.
